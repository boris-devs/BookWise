# BookWise 📚

BookWise is an intelligent book analysis system that combines a Deep Learning genre classifier (based on BERT) and a recommendation engine. The project enables users to predict book genres from descriptions and discover similar literature based on textual content.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Genre Classification**: Leverages the `bert-base-uncased` transformer model for Multi-label classification.
- **Recommendation System**: Finds similar books based on text similarity (titles, descriptions, and authors).
- **Web Interface**: Interactive UI for real-time predictions and book discovery (via `web.py`).
- **Data Pipeline**: Automated processing of the Goodreads dataset, including cleaning and feature engineering.

## 🏗 Project Structure

- `classifier.py` — Core Neural Network logic: training and inference using BERT and TensorFlow.
- `data_collector.py` — Data ingestion and preprocessing from CSV datasets.
- `recomendation.py` — Algorithms for finding similar books using NLP techniques.
- `train.py` — Entry point for training the classification model.
- `web.py` — Web application interface for user interaction.
- `settings.py` — Configuration management, paths, and global constants.
- `utils.py` — Helper functions and utilities.
- `datasets/` — Directory containing source data (`goodreads_ds.csv`).
- `bookwise_model/` — Saved model weights, tokenizer configs, and binarizers.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

The project is built with modern Machine Learning and Data Science libraries:
- **Python 3.12**
- **TensorFlow** & **Hugging Face Transformers** (BERT)
- **Pandas** & **NumPy** (Data Manipulation)
- **Scikit-learn** (Preprocessing & Binarization)
- **Uv** (Modern Python package manager)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies
Ensure you have [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) installed.

### 2. Dataset Preparation
Place your `goodreads_ds.csv` dataset into the `datasets/` folder.

### 3. Model Training
To train the genre classifier on your local data, run: train.py

The trained model and `MultiLabelBinarizer` will be saved to the `bookwise_model/` directory.

### 4. Running the App
Launch the web interface to start interacting with the system:

## 📊 How It Works

1. **Text Processing**: The system combines book titles, descriptions, and author lists into a cleaned `combined_text` feature, removing non-alphabetic characters.
2. **NLP Model**: Book descriptions are tokenized and passed through a BERT model to predict probabilities for the top 100 most common genres.
3. **Genre Prediction**: The system uses a threshold-based approach (default 0.5) to assign multiple genres to a single book, sorted by confidence percentage.
4. **Similarity**: Recommendations are generated by calculating similarity scores across the processed text features.
